Allows graphical and simple adjustment and display of employees final check.
This program was designed via request from my fiancee. She works at Smoothie King and at the end of each day, 1 or 2 people close the register. Unfortunately, they are very rarely even, and because of the employee contract, the amount over or short is divided among the people who closed that day and deducted from their pay check. This program allows compilation of an employee data base, and a nice SWT windows graphical user interface. I am using this project as a means to refresh my java memory, and to experiment with SWT.
